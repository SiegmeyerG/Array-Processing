# Array-Processing
The Matlab Code for DSP Tasks 
The code will estimate the direction of arrival(DoA) of sources using classical beamformer, MVDR and MUSIC techniques.  Different approached wre developed using Matlab functions, DoA computing algorithms and spectrum estimation. 

Run DoA_control_group(MATLAB Library), DoA_experiment(DoA_algorithms), and DoA_Spectrum(spectrum estimation) to see the results.
